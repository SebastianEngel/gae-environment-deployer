# Convenient shell script that can be used to deploy the same code to different
# Google App Engine environments.
# 
# The command-line tools "dev_appserver.py" and "appcfg.py" are expected to be
# available. Both are part of the Google App Engine SDK for Python. You can
# download the SDK at:
# https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python
#
#
# The script demonstrates the usage of the following three environments:
# 
# * local environment
# 
# 	Available at http://localhost:8080
#
# * staging environment
# 
# 	Available at http://YOUR_STAGING_ENV_APP_ID.appspot.com
#
# * live environment
# 
# 	Available at http://YOUR_LIVE_ENV_APP_ID.appspot.com
#
#
# If you habe a similar setup, just set your APP_IDs for APP_ID_LIVE_ENV
# and APP_ID_STAGING_ENV.
#
# If you have more environments, just add them to the script.
#
# 
# Usage:
# ======
# Deploy to any of your environments by execuring ./deploy.sh *environment*.
